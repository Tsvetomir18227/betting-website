# betting-website
The website is my first big project which is for betting simulated football matches. There are leaderboards for the first two leagues in England, Spain and Italy. The results of the matches are calculated randomly. If the bet is won, the user's profit is the money he bet * 2 (exactly not real money).

Everything is written in Bulgarian, because this was one of the conditions of the project.
